                        or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and
                        annoyances accepted.

                        The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects
                        pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.</p>
